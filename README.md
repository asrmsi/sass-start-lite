Adam's Sass Starter-Lite
========================

This is a less weighty version of my original sass-starter repo.

I use Bourbon, Neat & Bitters for a base, and I've included a couple of blank files for structure and organzation.

- style.scss - Contains all imports
- Bourbon
- _variables.scss - adjust defaults and define color schemes
- Bitters
- Neat
- Normalize
- Mixins - put your own stuff here
- Skeleton - apply grid structure to semantic elements, exclude any styles or formats here
- Modular Styles
	- Global
	- Header
	- Footer
	- Content
	- Auxilary
- Junk - crap that doesnt belong anywhere else

Caveat
================================

I barely know what I am doing. I intend for this to be a personal starting point for my own projects. If you want to use it, then by all means go for it, but I can't guarantee anything and would encourage you to check your (my) work.
